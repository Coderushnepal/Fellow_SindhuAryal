I came to know about the design of the things I have been surrounded by and started to develop a keen eye for the design of everyday things.
        Our classes start at 8 AM. I must say, I have developed a habit of getting up at around 5:30 AM every day since the fellowship started. Since my days start with all the good vibes, it has been helping me to stay positive and motivated throughout the day. I am enjoying how productive I have been so far.
        During the first week, I learned about the importance of color and the meaning it carries within itself. The classes made me aware of the typography on my mobile phone and even my laptop which somehow I had always taken for granted. One of the first assignments we were given was ‘to find examples of good and bad design in our vicinity’. Never had I ever thought that some of the apps and websites that I was uncomfortable with, were examples of bad design. I feel like I have gained some perspectives on identifying good and bad design and the consequences design can have on user experience. The same day, at the end of our classes we listened to music and noticed the effect it had upon us.
        On the second day, we learned the concept of UI / UX. I came to know that a user interface is the point of interaction between the user and a digital device or a product. Similarly, UX is how we feel when we look at the site/product. This day I learned about basic principles of design like proximity, space, alignment, contract, hierarchy, and repetition. In just the 2 days of my class, I knew this is exactly the kind of training I was looking for. Even though I had only covered the basics, yet my perspective of looking into things was completely different.
        
        We have a friendly facilitator, who makes sure every student understands the course material. I appreciate the effort of our mentors to help us understand the content. I am grateful to the teaching methodology where we get a chance to build leadership and presentation skills alongside.
        I used to have a hectic schedule before joining the Code Like Her fellowship, even if I wanted to dedicate my time to enhance my skills, I was unable to do so. This made me feel hopeless as I was having a hard time coping with time management. Currently, I have set my priorities and I am learning to manage my time based on them.
        Personally, it felt like the week went by in the blink of an eye. The sessions were much more informative than I had expected. The fellowship has provided such interesting and interactive sessions. I am looking forward to completing the rest of the journey with the same enthusiasm that I have now.`

        I must say, I was fortunate enough to get to learn about the computer from my early age in Pokhara. My teachers used to teach those theories so precisely that I used to have a very high craze for computing. I can vividly remember; those days were really fantastic. Later on, due to some reason, we migrated to Butwal. Then, everything got smashed upon us. It took years to create the same environment here.
        
        In 9th and 10th grades, HTML and QBASIC used to be my favorite topics. But after my SLC, I studied +2 science with Biology as major subject with an aim of entering medical science.
        
        But life didn’t go as planned.
        
        Unfortunately, my grandpa passed away, which became the turning point of my life. During this time, I got a chance to meet lots of my relatives; take their views which in turn helped me to shape my future and even helped me to get introduced to the important mysteries of the life. As per papa’s advice, I appeared in the entrance test of BSC.CSIT and passed the exam. That is how I stepped into the world of Information Technology.
        
        Having developed an interest in this career from the core of my heart, I moved on quickly. Luckily, I met my two seniors Hyarish Bhusal and Bishal Aryal, who really motivated, encouraged and worth saying, changed the course of my life. They made me more concerned about this field as they; themselves were actively involved in this field. Finally, with lots of hopes in my heart and dreams in my eyes, I joined BSc. CSIT at Butwal Multiple Campus. Slowly and gradually, I was able to know many experienced and genius faces of seniors who helped to build confidence in me that I could say, ‘Yeah, I’ve absolutely chosen one of the best careers’.
        
        The time was moving on continuously at its own pace. One day, I came to know about Butwal Coder Girls. With too much curiosity, I went to my seniors to have some information about it and learned right from its establishment stories to the future plans. I just loved them and got my membership the very next day. Working with the group, I’ve earned lots of experiences of not only about the internal issues but even how to deal with our external environment right from leadership motive to carrier development, that would take years to know about, if alone. I have also learned about team work and how to cope up with challenges. Actively participating in the field work, I was promoted as an Executive Member. All of the cohorts in the group have been working in this field in order to promote and encourage the girls to be in this sector. It is too difficult for a girl to move on with this career in our country as our society can’t tolerate a girl being busy in the laptops and cell phones. And, Butwal Coder Girls is trying to eliminate such problems by imparting knowledge about related fields, through interaction programs with the guardians and much more.
        
        After completing my education, I would like to work as a web developer. Your job as a web developer is to present your clients’ products and services to a wider mass by creating attractive, functional websites. Your work may include meeting with clients to discuss their desires for a website or discuss how to keep their websites functioning and up to date. You might construct the layout of a website, creating a visually interesting home page and user-friendly design. You may also write the content for the website. After a website is up and running, you will make sure that the site is functional on all web browsers, periodically testing and updating it as needed.  A client may also need you to include interactive capabilities on their site using Visual Basic or Java programming. And I’m on the way towards achieving this goal.
        
        All the girls interested in information technology can come join Butwal Coder Girls to make the mission successful. We will heartily welcome you and also love to share our experience with you.
        
        Lastly, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the entire team of Butwal Coder Girls, who supported me through my thick and thins and ultimately showing the direction to my career. I really feel very proud to be associated with Butwal Coder Girls. Also, I’m thankful to my lovable family and my uncle Suraj Aryal for your kind support.
        
        In a nutshell, flowers are very charming and whenever watched at, we would love to pluck them out. But if plucked, all its beauty gets vanished away. Similarly, via Butwal Coder Girls, I would love to see each and every girl glowing beautifully as those in a garland of flowers, and as lovely and important as an eyeball.

        "blogDescription": `India will reopen underground train networks and allow sports and religious events in a limited manner from next month as part of the government’s efforts to revive the economy, despite soaring coronavirus infections.

        India reported 76,472 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, slightly lower than the numbers seen in the last couple of days, but extending a run that has made the country’s outbreak currently the world’s worst, Reuters reports.
        
        The underground train network, a lifeline for millions in the capital city of New Delhi, will be reopened in a phased manner from 7 September, the federal home ministry said.
        Social, academic, sports and religious events will be allowed with a maximum of a 100 people from 21 September, it said.

Schools and colleges will remain closed until the end of September.

In all of the containment zones across the country - areas where the spread of infections is most severe - strict lockdown restrictions will remain in place, the government said.

India has reported a total of 3.46 million coronavirus cases, behind the United States and Brazil in terms of total caseload.

But it has reported higher single-day case rises than both those countries for almost two weeks.

India’s Covid-19 death toll rose by 1,021 to 62,550, data from the federal health ministry showed.`
